postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis anesthesia general endotracheal with epidural indication this patient is a 65yearold white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy he wa initially dry without pad and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising psa after that he began with episode of incontinence a well a urinary retention requiring catheterization one year ago he wa unable to catheterize and wa taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy he had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified there were also bladder stone that were lasered and removed and he had been incontinent ever since that time he wear 8 to 10 pad per day and this ha affected his quality of life significantly i took him to the operating room on january 16 2008 and found diffuse radiation change with a small capacity bladder and wideopen bladder neck we both felt that his lower urinary tract wa not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problem facing him i felt like if we could remove the bladder safely then this would also provide a benefit finding at exploration there were no gross lesion of the smaller or large bowel the bladder wa predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally the opened bladder which we were able to remove completely had a wideopen capacious diverticulum in it very distal segment because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis i elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing a well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which wa exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment procedure in detail the patient wa brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained placed in the supine position flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion a nasogastric tube wa placed a well a radial arterial line he wa given intravenous antibiotic for prophylaxis a generous midline skin incision wa made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis deep into the rectus fascia the rectus muscle separated in the midline and exploration carried out with the finding described moist wound towel and a bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure we began by retracting the bowel by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum the ureter wa identified a a crisis over the iliac vessel and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clip an identical procedure wa performed in the left side with similar finding and the bowel were packed cephalad we began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side wall staying medial to both epigastric artery this wa quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy we essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly a best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicle and these were taken between double clip approximately and clipped distally we then approached thing posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder there wa some remnant seminal vesicle on the right a well a both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum we then entered the bladder anteriorly a distal a we could and remove the bladder and what we thought wa a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum we then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field bladder wa irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection wa made for hemostasis we then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon this allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension we then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon the colon wa divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia80 stapler i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum the mesentery wa then sealed with a ligasure device and divided and the bowel wa divided with a gia60 stapler we then performed a sidetoside ileotransverse colostomy using a gia80 stapler closing the open end with a ta 60 the angle were reinforced with silk suture and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk suture we then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum passed a 12french robinson catheter into the cecal segment and plicated the ileum with 3 firing of the gia60 stapler the ileocecal valve wa then reinforced with interrupted 30 silk suture a described by rowland et al and following this passage of an 18french robinson catheter wa associated with the characteristic pop indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve a the patient had had a previous appendectomy we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 30 vicryl suture the bowel segment wa then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive application of the sgia polysorb75 between the staple line vicryl suture were placed and the defect closed with 30 vicryl suture ligature we then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis the left ureter wa mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an endtoside anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 40 vicryl suture and this wa stented with a cook 84french ureteral stent and this wa secured to the bowel lumen with a 50 chromic suture the right ureter wa brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis we then brought the stent out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 20 chromic suture a 24french malecot catheter wa placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture the staple line were then buried with a running 30 vicryl twolayer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture the pouch wa filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight and the ureteral anastomosis were intact we then made a final inspection for hemostasis the cecostomy tube wa then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk suture we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this a portion of the ileum wa removed and healthy wellvascularized tissue wa matured with interrupted 30 chromic suture we left an 18french robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk suture the malecot and stent were also secured in a similar fashion we matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitch the stitch wa brought out to the right upper quadrant and the malecot to the left lower

30 prolene stay tie staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body the corporal body wa opened up and the cylinder wa removed from the right side without difficulty however we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this wa surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of bovie cautery this wa very difficult and wa very time consuming but we were able to do this and attention wa then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy wa made after placement of two stick tie stay suture this wa done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this wa done proximally on the corporal body the left cylinder wa then subsequently explanted and this wa very difficult a well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this wa also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding which wa controlled with monopolar and cautery wa used on three different occasion but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there wa no ectopy noted after removal of half of the pump all the tubing and both cylinder these were passed off the table a specimen both corporal body were then dilated with the pratt dilator these were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinder and antibiotic irrigation wa copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal space at this point using the farlow device corporal body were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally he had an 18 cm with rear tip in place which were removed we decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis confident with our size we then placed rear tip originally 3 cm rear tip however we had difficulty placing the rear tip into the left crest we felt that this wa just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tip and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm at this point we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the farlow device and the keith needle which wa brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip wa subsequently placed proximally entered the crest without difficulty attention wa then taken to the left side with the same thing wa carried out however we did happen to dilate on two separate occasion both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit a well a buckling of the cylinder this then forced u to down size to the 1 cm rear tip which slipping very easily with the farlow device through the glans penis there wa no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea the rear tip were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #

common iliac presacral bilateral external iliac lymph node salvage radical cystoprostatectomy very difficult due to previous chemotherapy and radiation therapy and continent urinary diversion with an indiana pouch anesthesia general endotracheal and epidural indication this patient is a 65yearold white male who wa diagnosed with a highgrade invasive bladder cancer in june 2005 during the course of his workup of transurethral resection he had a heart attack when he wa taken off plavix after having had a drugeluting stent placed in he recovered from this and then underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy with a brief response documented by cystoscopy and biopsy after which he had another ischemic event the patient ha been followed regularly by myself and dr x and ha been continuously free of disease since that time in that interval he had a coronary artery bypass graft and wa taken off of plavix most recently he had a pet ct which showed new right hydronephrosis and a followup cystoscopy which showed a new abnormality in the right side of his bladder where he previously had the tumor resected and treated i took him to the operating room and extensively resected this area with finding of a highgrade muscle invasive bladder cancer we could not identify the right ureteral orifice and he had a right ureteral stent placed metastatic workup wa negative and cardiology felt he wa at satisfactory medical risk for surgery and he wa taken to the operating room this time for planned salvage cystoprostatectomy he wa interested in orthotopic neobladder and i felt like that would be reasonable if resecting around the urethra indicated the tissue wa healthier therefore we planned on an indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion operative finding on exploration there were multiple abnormality outside the bladder a follows there were at least three small lesion within the distal small bowel the predominant one measured about 15 cm in diameter with a white scar on the surface there were two much smaller lesion also with a small white scar with very little palpable mass the larger of the two wa resected and found to be a carcinoid tumor there also were change in the small bowel mesentry that looked inflammatory and biopsy of this showed only fibrous tissue and histiocyte the small bowel mesentry wa fairly thickened at the base but no discrete abnormality noted both common iliac and lymph node sample were very thickened and indurated and frozen section of the left showed cancer cell that were somewhat degenerative suggesting a chemotherapy and radiation therapy effect viability wa unable to be determined there wa a frozen section of the distal right external iliac lymph node that wa negative the bladder wa very thickened and abnormal suggesting extensive cancer penetrating just under the peritoneal surface the bladder wa fairly stuck to the pelvic sidewall and anterior symphysis pubis requiring very meticulous resection in order to get it off of these structure the external iliac lymph node were resected on both side of the obturator the lymph packet however wa very stuck and adherent to the pelvic sidewall and i elected not to remove that the rest of the large bowel appeared normal there were no mass in the liver and the gallbladder wa surgically absent there wa nasogastric tube in the stomach operative procedure in detail the patient wa brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained having placed in the supine position and flexed over the anterior superior iliac spine his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion the radiologist placed a radial arterial line and an intravenous catheter intravenous antibiotic were given for prophylaxis we made a generous midline skin incision from high end of the epigastrium down to the symphysis pubis deepened through the rectus fascia and the rectus muscle separated in the midline exploration wa carried out with the finding described the bladder wa adherent and did appear immobile moist wound towel and a bookwalter retractor wa placed for exposure we began by assessing the small and large bowel with the finding in the small bowel a described we subsequently resected the largest of the lesion by exogenous wedge resection and reanastomosed the small bowel with a twolayer running 40 prolene suture we then mobilized the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure after incising the white line of toldt and mobilized the terminal ileal mesentery up to the second and third portion of the duodenum the ureter were carefully dissected out and down deep in the true pelvis the right ureter wa thickened and hydronephrotic with a stent in place and the left wa of normal caliber i kept the ureter intact until we were moving the bladder off a described above at that point we then ligated the ureter with the rp45 vascular load and divided it we then established the proximal ____________ laterally to both genitofemoral nerve and resected the precaval and periaortic lymph node the common iliac lymph node remained stuck to the ureter frozen section with the finding described on the left i then began the dissection over the right external iliac artery and vein and had a great deal of difficulty dissecting distally i wa however able to establish the distal plane of dissection and a large lymph node wa present in the distal external iliac vessel clip were used to control the lymphatics distally these lymph node were sent for frozen section which wa negative we made no attempt to circumferentially mobilize the vessel but essentially swept the tissue off of the anterior surface and towards the bladder and then removed it the obturator nerve on the right side wa sucked into the pelvic sidewall and i elected not to remove those on the left side thing were a little bit more mobile in term of the lymph node but still the obturator lymph node were left intact we then worked on the lateral pedicle on both side and essentially determined that i can take these down i then mobilized the later half of the symphysis pubis and pubic ramus to get distal to the apical prostate at this point i scrubbed out of the operation talked to the family and indicated that i felt the cystectomy wa more palliative than therapeutic and i reiterated his desire to be free of any external appliance i then proceeded to take down the lateral pedicle with an rp45 stapler on the right and clip distally the endopelvic fascia wa incised i then turned my attention posteriorly and incised the peritoneum overlying the anterior rectal wall and ramus very meticulously dissected the rectum away from the posterior denonvilliers fascia i intentionally picked down those two pedicle lateral to the rectum between the clip and then turned my attention retropubically i wa able to pas a 0 vicryl suture along the dorsal venous complex tied this and then sealed and divided the complex with a ligasure and oversewed it distally with 20 vicryl figureofeight stitch i then divided the urethra distal to the apex of the prostate divided the foley catheter between the clamp and then the posterior urethra i then wa able to take down the remaining distal attachment of the apex and took the dissection off the rectum and the specimen wa then free of all attachment and handed off the operative field the bivalved prostate appeared normal we then carefully inspected the rectal wall and noted to be intact the wound wa irrigated with 1 l of warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection made for hemostasis and a dry pack placed in the pelvis we then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon the colon wa divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia80 stapler i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum the mesentery wa then sealed with a ligasure device and divided and the bowel wa divided with a gia60 stapler we then performed a sidetoside ileotransverse colostomy using a gia80 stapler closing the open end with a ta 60 the angle were reinforced with silk suture and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk suture we then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum passed a 12french robinson catheter into the cecal segment and plicated the ileum with 3 firing of the gia60 stapler the ileocecal valve wa then reinforced with interrupted 30 silk suture a described by rowland et al and following this passage of an 18french robinson catheter wa associated with the characteristic pop indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve a the patient had had a previous appendectomy we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 30 vicryl suture the bowel segment wa then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive application of the sgia polysorb75 between the staple line vicryl suture were placed and the defect closed with 30 vicryl suture ligature we then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis the left ureter wa mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an endtoside anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 40 vicryl suture and this wa stented with a cook 84french ureteral stent and this wa secured to the bowel lumen with a 50 chromic suture the right ureter wa brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis we then brought the stent out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 20 chromic suture a 24french malecot catheter wa placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture the staple line were then buried with a running 30 vicryl twolayer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture the pouch wa filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight and the ureteral anastomosis were intact we then made a final inspection for hemostasis the cecostomy tube wa then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk suture we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this a portion of the ileum wa removed and healthy wellvascularized tissue wa matured with interrupted 30 chromic suture we left an 18french robinson through the stoma and secured this to the skin with silk suture the malecot and stent were also secured in a similar fashion the stoma wa returned to the umbilicus after resecting the terminal ileum we then placed a large jp drain into both obturator fossa and brought it up the right lower quadrant rectus fascia wa closed with buried # 2 prolene stitch anchoring a new

2651,reason for hospitalization suspicious calcification upper outer quadrant left breast history of present illness the patient is a 78yearold woman who had undergone routine screening mammography on 06 04 08 that study disclosed the presence of punctate calcification that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 oclock position additional imaging study confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcification the patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 oclock position on 06 17 08 the final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis no calcification could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissue two day post stereotactic core needle biopsy however the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast she underwent sonographic evaluation and wa found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy i wa called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center at the same time dr y wa consulted in interventional radiology dr z and dr y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this wa injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material this resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm the patient wa seen in my office for followup appointment on 06 24 08 at that time the patient continued to have sign of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy there wa however no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm there wa no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest wall i discussed the issue with the patient and her husband the underlying problem is that the suspicious calcification which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy therefore the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging finding for this reason the patient wa advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization since the breast mound wa significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy the decision wa to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four month the patient now return to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcification the patient ha a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast which wa performed on 01 27 04 this revealed benign histologic finding the family history is positive

incision wa made and cautery wa used to expose the suboccipital bone once the suboccipital bone wa exposed under the foramen magnum the high speed drill wa used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with leksell and insertion with kerrison punch down to the rim of the foramen magnum a well a laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus the dura wa then opened in a cruciate fashion the cisterna magna wa drained which nicely relaxed the cerebellum the dura leaf were held back with the 40 nurolon the microscope wa then brought into the field and under the microscope the cerebellar hemisphere wa elevated laterally the arachnoid wa very thick this wa opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor wa identified the tumor wa quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa initially two retractor were used one on the tentorium and one inferiorly the arachnoid wa taken down off the tumor there were multiple blood vessel on the surface which were bipolared the tumor surface wa then opened with microscissors and the cavitron wa used to began debulking the lesion this wa a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum however a the tumor wa able to be debulked the edge began to be mobilized the redundant capsule wa bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor working inferiorly and then superiorly the

abdominal fat graft into sella turcica reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of le than 5 cm repair of nasal septal deviation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion indication for procedure this man ha undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resection of his tumor which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma he did not return for followup or radiotherapy a instructed and the tumor ha regrown for this reason he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove a much tumor a possible the highrisk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory wa made clear to him many risk including csf leak and blindness were discussed in detail after clear understanding of all the same he elected to proceed ahead with surgery procedure the patient wa placed on the operating table and after adequate induction of general anesthesia he wa placed in the left lateral decubitus position care wa taken to pad all pressure point appropriately the back wa prepped and draped in usual sterile manner a 14gauge tuohy needle wa introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space clear and colorless csf issued forth a catheter wa inserted to a distance of 40 cm and the needle wa removed the catheter wa then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion this notouch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patient with large invasive adenoma via injection through the lumbar drain one increase intracranial pressure and produce gentle migration of the tumor this improves outcome and reduces complication by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus the patient wa then placed supine and the 3point headrest wa affixed he wa placed in the semisitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder care wa taken to pad all pressure point appropriately the fluoroscope carm unit wa then positioned so a to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection the metallic arm wa then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope the oropharynx nasopharynx and abdominal area were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner a transverse incision wa made in the abdominal region and several large piece of fat were harvested for later use hemostasis wa obtained the wound wa carefully closed in layer i then advanced a 0degree endoscope up the left nostril the middle turbinate wa identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium needle bovie electrocautery wa used to clear mucosa away from the ostium the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid i entered into the sphenoid there wa a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present and i slowly and carefully worked through all this i identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left which wa very well exposed and the cavernous sinus on the right which i exposed the very medial portion of the opening wa wide until i had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present the operating microscope wa then utilized working under magnification i used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril the dura wa then carefully opened in the midline and i immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma a frozen section wa obtained which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant feature slowly and meticulously i worked to remove the tumor i used the suction apparatus a well a the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free the tumor wa moderately vascular and very fibrotic slowly and carefully i systematically entered the sellar content until i could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right there appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left it wa consistent with what we saw on the mri imaging the portion working into the suprasellar cistern wa slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter a large amount of this wa removed there wa a csf leak a the tumor wa removed for the upper surface of it wa very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free under high magnification i actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor while there may be a small amount of tumor remaining it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus in fact i reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well i reasoned that i had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression attention wa therefore turned to closure the wound wa copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained i asked anesthesiology to perform a valsalva maneuver and there wa no evidence of bleeding attention wa turned to closure and reconstruction i placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there wa no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air using a polypropylene insert i reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of le than 5 cm duraseal wa placed over this and the sphenoid sinus wa carefully packed with fat and duraseal i inspected the nasal passage and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation the middle turbinate were then restored to their anatomic position there wa no significant intranasal bleeding and for this reason an open nasal packing wa required sterile dressing were applied and the operation wa terminated the patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition the sponge and needle count were reported a correct and there were no intraoperative complication specimen were sent to pathology consisting of tumor,Brain

2699,title of operation leftsided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure indication for surgery the patient is a patient well known to my service she came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fracture of the right side of the skull i took her to the operating a few day ago for a large rightsided hemicraniectomy to save her life i spoke with the family the mom especially about the risk benefit and alternative of this procedure most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor gc of 3 in some brainstem reflex i discussed with them that this wa a lifesaving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery a a level 1 we went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large rightsided hemicraniectomy the patient wa put in the intensive care unit we had placed also at that time a leftsided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few day ago over the last few day the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination that is she wa at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be le brisk we obtained a ct scan at this point and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 15 cm of midline shift at this point once again i discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a leftsided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________ this wa once again a lifesaving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side procedure in detail the patient wa taken to the operating room she wa already intubated and under general anesthesia the head wa put in a 3pin mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pin in the back to be able to put the patient with the righthand side down and the lefthand side up since on the righthand side she did not have a bone flap which complicated matter a little bit so we had to use a 3pin mayfield headholder the patient tolerated this well we sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery so we incorporated this incision into the new incision and to be able to open the skin on the left side we did a tshaped incision with t vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin we connected this prior to this we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard condition we opened the skin a in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap we brought in the muscle with it we had a very good exposure of the skull we identified all the important landmark including the zygoma inferiorly the superior sagittal suture a well a posteriorly and anteriorly we had very good landmark so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly a very large decompression of the left side at this point we opened the dura and the dura a soon a it wa opened there wa a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusion over the operculum a well a posteriorly all this wa irrigated thoroughly once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complication we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal a well a the superior temporal artery very nicely we had absolutely good hemostasis we put a piece of gelfoam over the brain we had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it wa in the dependent position i went ahead and irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of duragen a well a a piece of gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place this running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables although i put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely once we had done this irrigated thoroughly once again the skin we cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit the ebl wa about 200 cubic centimeter her hematocrit went down to about 21 and i ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood intraoperatively which they began to work on a we began to continue to do the work and the sponge and the needle count were correct no complication the patient went back to the intensive care unit,Brain

technique the patient wa brought to the operating room preoperative evaluation included previous cervical spine surgery the patient initially had some relief however his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse repeat study including myelogram and postspinal ct revealed some blunting of the nerve root at c4c5 and c5c6 there wa also noted to be some annular bulge at c3c4 and c6c7 the ct scan in march revealed that the fusion wa not fully solid xrays were done in november including flexion and extension view it appeared that the fusion wa solid the patient had been on pain medication the patient had undergone several nonoperative treatment he wa given the option of surgical intervention we discussed botox i discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression i explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck and that no guarantee would help there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it wa from the anterior surgery if at the time of surgery there wa some motion of the c4c5 level i would recommend a fusion the patient wa a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but ha not quit smoking i have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft i explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life even if this type of bone graft wa used there wa no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely the patient also wa advised that if i did a fusion i would also use post instrumentation which wa a wire the wire would be left permanently even with all these procedure there wa no guarantee that his symptom would improve his numbness tingling and weakness could get worse rather than better his neck pain and arm pain could persist he still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure other procedure may be necessary later there is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function he could lose total control of his arm or leg and end up in the bed for the rest of his life he could develop chronic regional pain syndrome he could get difficulty swallowing or eating he could have substantial weakness in the arm he wa advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent severe and unremitting he wa also offered his record if he would like any other pain medication or seek other treatment he wa advised that dr x would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery he stated he understood all the risk he did not wish to get any other treatment he said the pain ha reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery procedure in detail in the operating room he wa given general endotracheal anesthesia i then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic roll his head wa controlled by a horseshoe holder the anesthesiologist checked the eye position to make sure there wa no pressure on the orbit and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minute the arm the right hip and the neck wa then prepped and draped care wa taken to position both arm and both leg pulse were checked a midline incision wa made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine a loupe magnification and headlamp illumination wa used bleeding vessel were cauterized meticulous hemostasis wa carried out throughout the procedure gradually and carefully i exposed the spinous process of the c6 c5 and c4 a lateral view wa done after an instrument in place this revealed the c6c7 level i therefore did a small laminotomy opening at c4c5 i placed an instrument and xrays confirmed c4c5 level i stripped the muscle from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a selfretaining retractor once i identified the level i then used a bur to thin the lamina of c5 i used a 1mm followed by a 2mm kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off c5 on the left i removed some of the superior lamina of c6 and some of the inferior lamina of c4 this allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve root and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the c5 and c6 nerve root there wa some bleeding from the epidural vein and a bipolar cautery wa used absolutely no retractor were ever placed in the canal there wa no retraction i wa able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc space to make sure there wa no fragment of disc or herniation disc and none were found at the end of the procedure the neuroforamen were widely patent the nerve root had been fully decompressed i then checked stability there wa micromotion at the c4c5 level i therefore elected to proceed with a fusion i debrided the interspinous ligament between c4 and c5 i used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of c5 and the inferior portion of c4 using a small drill i opened the facet at c4c5 i then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage i used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at c4c5 attention wa turned to the right and left hip which wa also prepped an incision made over the iliac crest bleeding vessel were cauterized i exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest i removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone i placed the songer wire through the base of the spinous process of c4 and c5 drill hole made with a clip i then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process i then tightened the songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire prior to tightening the wire i also packed cancellous bone with facet at c4c5 i then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of c4 and c5 the hip wound wa irrigated with bacitracin and kantrex deep structure were closed with # 1 vicryl

3 week which would have made this man worse simply over time i thus elected to give him ddavp platelet and used horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis this took literally halfanhour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case eventually with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameter under control bleeding wa somewhat slow i then selected two 10 and one 9mm cadaveric allograft which had soaking in bacitracin solution these were trimmed to the desired dimension and under slight distraction these were tapped into position excellent graft alignment wa achieved i now brought in a depuy titanium eagle plate and i fixed it to the spine from c3 to c6 fourteen millimeter screw were used all the screw were tightened and torqued the patient bone quality

then closed in layer the dura wa closed with interrupted and running mattress of 40 nurolon the dura wa watertight and it wa covered with blue glue gelfoam wa placed over the dural closure then the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layer using # 0 ethibond subcutaneous wa closed with interrupted inverted 20 and 0 vicryl and the skin wa closed with running locking 30 nylon for the cranial incision the ventriculostomy wa brought out through a separate stab wound the bone flap wa brought on to the field the dura wa closed with running and interrupted 40 nurolon at the beginning of the case dural tackups had been made and these were still in place the sinus both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus were covered with thrombinsoaked gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding area in the sinus once the dura wa closed the bone flap wa returned to the wound and held in place with the lorenz microplates the wound wa then closed in layer the galea wa closed with multiple

2715,preoperative diagnosis left acoustic neuroma postoperative diagnosis left acoustic neuroma procedure performed left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma anesthesia general operative finding this patient had a 3cm acoustic neuroma the tumor wa incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem at 005 milliampere at the conclusion of the dissection procedure in detail following induction of adequate general anesthetic the patient wa positioned for surgery she wa placed in a lateral position and her head wa maintained with mayfield pin the left periauricular area wa shaved prepped and draped in the sterile fashion transdermal electrode for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed and no response wa verified the proposed incision wa injected with 1 xylocaine with epinephrine next tshaped incision wa made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease the incision wa undermined at the level of temporalis fascia and the portion of the fascia wa harvested for further use incision wa made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip periosteal elevator wa used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone emissary vein posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax bergen retractor were used to maintain exposure using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy wa performed the sigmoid sinus wa identified anteriorly and the transverse site were identified superiorly from these structure approximately 4 x 4 cm a window of bone wa removed bone shaving were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use the bone flap wa also left at the site for further use dissection wa extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base bone wax wa used to occlude air cell lateral to the sigmoid sinus there wa extensively aerated temporal bone at this point dr trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor the cerebellum wa retracted away from the tumor and the retractor wa placed to help maintain exposure once initial exposure wa completed attention wa directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone the dura wa excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone then using diamond bur the internal auditory canal wa dissected out the bone wa removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm there wa considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal a well the dura wa then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor wa difficult therefore dr trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portion of the tumor with dissection he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem the eighth nerve wa identified and transected tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem the facial nerve wa difficult to identify at the brainstem a well it wa identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time wa the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this wa difficult to achieve attention wa then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor wa removed the superior and inferior vestibular nerve were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus at this point plane of dissection wa again indistinct the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated the tumor wa further debulked and thinned but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor the nerve could be stimulated but wa quite splayed over the anterior face further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempt were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve both proximally and distally however the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve wa not usually delineated however the tumor wa then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness it wa released from the brainstem ventrally the tumor wa then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 005 milliampere overall the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume at this point dr trask reinspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis the air cell around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax a piece of fascia wa then laid over the bone defect next the dura wa closed with duragen and duraseal the bone flap and bone were then placed in the bone defect postauricular musculature wa then reapproximated using interrupted 30 vicryl suture the skin wa also closed using interrupted subdermal 30 vicryl suture running 40 nylon suture wa placed at the skin level sterile mastoid dressing

source of neck pain a documented by facet injection a detailed discussion ensued with the patient a to the pro and con of the surgery by two level versus three level because of the severe component of the neck pain that ha been relieved with facet injection we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at c3c4 c4c5 and c5c6 i explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risk and alternative he clearly understands and ha no further question and request that i proceed procedure the patient wa placed on the operating room table and wa intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position the methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol wa instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosage the left side of the neck wa carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner a transverse incision wa made in the neck crease dissection wa carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine wa exposed the medial border of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachment to the spine caspar selfretaining pin were placed into the body of c3 c4 c5 and c6 and xray localization wa obtained a needle wa placed in what wa revealed to be the disk space at c4c5 and an xray confirmed proper localization selfretaining retractor were then placed in the wound taking great care to keep the blade of the retractor underneath the longus colli muscle first i removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophyte at c5c6 and distracted the space the highspeed cutting bur wa used to drill back the osteophyte towards the posterior lip of the vertebral body an incision wa then made at c4c5 and the annulus wa incised and a discectomy wa performed back to the posterior lip of the vertebral body the retractor were then adjusted and again discectomy wa performed at c3c4 back to the posterior lip of the vertebral body the operating microscope wa then utilized working under magnification i started at c3c4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament the ligament wa incised and the underlying dura wa exposed i worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the c4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen there were a large number of vein overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding i left them intact however i could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right the microscope wa angled to the left side where similar decompression wa achieved the retractor were readjusted and attention wa turned to c4c5 i worked down through bony osteophyte and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament the ligament wa incised and a i worked to the right of the midline i encountered herniated disk material which wa removed in a number of large piece the c5 root wa exposed and then widely decompressed until i wa flush with the pedicle and into the foramen the root had a somewhat high takeoff but i worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it again the microscope wa angled to the left side where similar decompression wa achieved central decompression wa achieved here where there wa a moderate amount of spinal cord compression this wa removed by undercutting with 1 and 2mm cloward punch attention wa then turned to the c5c6 space here there were large osteophyte projecting posteriorly against the cord i slowly and carefully used the highspeed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2mm cloward punch to widely decompress the spinal cord this necessitated undercutting the body of both c5 and c6 extensively but i wa then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord i exposed the c6 root and widely decompressed it until i wa flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right the microscope wa angled to the left side where a similar decompression wa achieved attention wa then turned to creation of the arthrodesis a highspeed cornerstone bur wa used to decorticate the body of c5c6 c4c5 and c3c4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration bone dust during the drilling wa harvested for later use attention wa turned to creation of the arthrodesis using the various synthes sizers i selected a 7mm lordotic graft at c5c6 and an 8mm lordotic graft at c4c5 and a 9mm lordotic graft at c3c4 each graft wa filled with autologous bone from the vertebral body and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge i decided to use bmp in this case because there were three level of fusion and because this patient ha a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two week the bmp sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft under distraction the graft wa placed at c3c4 c4c5 and c5c6 a described an xray wa obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis attention wa turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation various size of synthes plate were selected until i decided that a 54mm plate wa appropriate the plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral body had to be drilled so that the plate would sit flush the hole were drilled and the screw were placed eight screw were placed with two screw at c3 two screw at c4 two screw at c5 and two screw at c6 all eight screw had good purchase the locking screw were tightly applied an xray wa obtained which showed good placement of the graft plate and screw attention wa turned to closure the wound wa copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained a medium hemovac drain wa placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin the wound wa then carefully closed in layer sterile dressing were applied and the operation wa terminated the patient

2768,title of operation right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty indication for surgery the patient with a large 35 cm acoustic neuroma the patient is having surgery for resection there wa significant cerebellar peduncle compression the tumor wa very difficult due to it size a well a it adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex the case took 12 hour this wa more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma preop diagnosis right acoustic neuroma postop diagnosis right acoustic neuroma procedure the patient wa brought to the operating room general anesthesia wa induced in the usual fashion after appropriate line were placed the patient wa placed in mayfield 3point head fixation hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area a timeout wa settled with nursing and anesthesia and the head wa shaved prescrubbed with chlorhexidine prepped and draped in the usual fashion the incision wa made and cautery wa used to expose the suboccipital bone once the suboccipital bone wa exposed under the foramen magnum the high speed drill wa used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with leksell and insertion with kerrison punch down to the rim of the foramen magnum a well a laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus the dura wa then opened in a cruciate fashion the cisterna magna wa drained which nicely relaxed the cerebellum the dura leaf were held back with the 40 nurolon the microscope wa then brought into the field and under the microscope the cerebellar hemisphere wa elevated laterally the arachnoid wa very thick this wa opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor wa identified the tumor wa quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa initially two retractor were used one on the tentorium and one inferiorly the arachnoid wa taken down off the tumor there were multiple blood vessel on the surface which were bipolared the tumor surface wa then opened with microscissors and the cavitron wa used to began debulking the lesion this wa a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum however a the tumor wa able to be debulked the edge began to be mobilized the redundant capsule wa bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor working inferiorly and then superiorly the tumor wa taken down off the tentorium a well a out the 9th 10th or 11th nerve complex it wa very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex the brainstem wa identified above the complex similarly inferiorly the brainstem wa able to be identified and cotton ball were placed to maintain this plain attention wa then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex there were multitude of vein including the lateral pontine vein which were coming right into this area the lateral pontine vein wa maintained microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain and then working inferiorly the 7th nerve wa identified coming off the brainstem a number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane this then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton ball were then placed a number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve cavitron wa used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection wa carried out the nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this the tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it wa completely off the cavitron wa used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus the tumor wa debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument a well a the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus at this point the capsule wa so redundant it wa felt to isolate the nerve in the porus there wa minimal bulk remaining intracranially all the cotton ball were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem dr x then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that wa left in the porus and coming out of the porus i then scrubbed back into case once dr x had completed removing this portion of the tumor there wa no tumor remaining at this point i placed some norian in the porus to seal any air cell although there were no palpated an intradural space wa then irrigated thoroughly there wa no bleeding the nerve wa attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level but it did not stimulate at this time the dura wa then closed with 40 nurolons in interrupted fashion a muscle plug wa used over one area duragen wa laid and strip over the suture line followed by hemaseel gelfoam wa set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty wa carried out the wound wa then irrigated thoroughly o vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia 30 vicryl for subcutaneous tissue and 30 nylon on the skin the patient wa extubated and taken to the icu in stable condition,Brain

the left mother report he posture the left upper extremity when running he is being followed by medical therapy unit and ha also been seen in the past by dr x he ha not received botox or any other intervention with regard to his cerebral palsy the patient did require one shunt revision but since then his shunt ha done well the patient developed seizure about 2 year ago these occurred periodically but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side his event however always tend to be prolonged he ha had seizure a long a an hour and a half he tends to require multiple medication to stop them he ha been followed by dr y and wa started on trileptal at one point the patient wa taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizure he wa more recently placed on topamax since march 2007 his last seizure were in march and may respectively he is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsule 2 capsule twice a day or about 5 mg kg day at this point the patient wa in his usual state of health until early this morning and wa noted to be in seizure his seizure this morning wa similar to the previous seizure with forced deviation of his head and eye to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right family administered diastat 75 mg x1 dose they did not know they could repeat this dose em wa called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department 15 mg kg of fosphenytoin his seizure stopped thereafter since that time he had gradually become more alert and is eating and is nearly back to baseline he is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally review of system at this time he is positive for a lowgrade fever he ha had no sign of illness otherwise he doe have some fever after his prolonged seizure he denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaint there is no

tendon reflex are 2+ and symmetric when sitting up he show some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis he also show some scoliotic curve of the spine which is mild at this point gait wa not tested today impression this is a 6yearold male with recurrent status epilepticus left hemiparesis history of prematurity and intraventricular hemorrhage he is on topamax which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg kg a day or 50 mg twice a day at this point it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not but the dose is clearly not at maximum and he is tolerating the dose currently the plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning and 75 mg at night for 2 week and then 75 mg twice daily reviewed the possible side effect of higher dos of topamax they will monitor him for language issue cognitive problem or excessive somnolence i also discussed his imaging study which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other area and despite this the patient at baseline ha a reasonable balance the plan from ct standpoint is to continue stretching program continue with medical therapy unit he may benefit from botox in addition i reviewed the diastat protocol with parent and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time they can administer diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minute or even 5 minute that they were waiting before they are going to repeat the dose within 10 minute and they can call em at any point during that time hopefully at home they need to start to abort these seizure or the higher dose of topamax will prevent them other medication option would include keppra zonegran or lamictal followup followup ha already been scheduled with dr y in february and they will continue to keep that date for followup,Brain

abdominal fat graft into sella turcica reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of le than 5 cm repair of nasal septal deviation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion indication for procedure this man ha undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resection of his tumor which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma he did not return for followup or radiotherapy a instructed and the tumor ha regrown for this reason he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove a much tumor a possible the highrisk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory wa made clear to him many risk including csf leak and blindness were discussed in detail after clear understanding of all the same he elected to proceed ahead with surgery procedure the patient wa placed on the operating table and after adequate induction of general anesthesia he wa placed in the left lateral decubitus position care wa taken to pad all pressure point appropriately the back wa prepped and draped in usual sterile manner a 14gauge tuohy needle wa introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space clear and colorless csf issued forth a catheter wa inserted to a distance of 40 cm and the needle wa removed the catheter wa then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion this notouch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patient with large invasive adenoma via injection through the lumbar drain one increase intracranial pressure and produce gentle migration of the tumor this improves outcome and reduces complication by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus the patient wa then placed supine and the 3point headrest wa affixed he wa placed in the semisitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder care wa taken to pad all pressure point appropriately the fluoroscope carm unit wa then positioned so a to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection the metallic arm wa then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope the oropharynx nasopharynx and abdominal area were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner a transverse incision wa made in the abdominal region and several large piece of fat were harvested for later use hemostasis wa obtained the wound wa carefully closed in layer i then advanced a 0degree endoscope up the left nostril the middle turbinate wa identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium needle bovie electrocautery wa used to clear mucosa away from the ostium the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid i entered into the sphenoid there wa a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present and i slowly and carefully worked through all this i identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left which wa very well exposed and the cavernous sinus on the right which i exposed the very medial portion of the opening wa wide until i had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present the operating microscope wa then utilized working under magnification i used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril the dura wa then carefully opened in the midline and i immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma a frozen section wa obtained which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant feature slowly and meticulously i worked to remove the tumor i used the suction apparatus a well a the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free the tumor wa moderately vascular and very fibrotic slowly and carefully i systematically entered the sellar content until i could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right there appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left it wa consistent with what we saw on the mri imaging the portion working into the suprasellar cistern wa slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter a large amount of this wa removed there wa a csf leak a the tumor wa removed for the upper surface of it wa very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free under high magnification i actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor while there may be a small amount of tumor remaining it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus in fact i reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well i reasoned that i had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression attention wa therefore turned to closure the wound wa copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained i asked anesthesiology to perform a valsalva maneuver and there wa no evidence of bleeding attention wa turned to closure and reconstruction i placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there wa no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air using a polypropylene insert i reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of le than 5 cm duraseal wa placed over this and the sphenoid sinus wa carefully packed with fat and duraseal i inspected the nasal passage and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation the middle turbinate were then restored to their anatomic position there wa no significant intranasal bleeding and for this reason an open nasal packing wa required sterile dressing were applied and the operation wa terminated the patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition the sponge and needle count were reported a correct and there were no intraoperative complication specimen were sent to pathology consisting of tumor,Brain

patient in pin and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp wa prepped with betadine after shave a well a the abdomen the neck wa prepped a well after this wa performed i made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl a wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck wa then incised with the bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place a the auricle wa reflected over anterior to the condyle after this wa performed i used the bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible the condyle wa skeletonized so that it could be easily seen the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid wa dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve wa identified and spared the neck content to the hyoid were dissected out the hypoglossal nerve vagus nerve and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen the neck content were removed a a separate specimen the external carotid artery wa identified and tied off a it entered the parotid and tied with a hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis a large posterior facial vein wa identified and likewise clipped for later use i then used the cutting and diamond bur to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so a to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb it became evident there wa two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore i did use the router i mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube the internal carotid artery wa dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and i drilled carotid canal up until it made i dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out a it entered the temporal bone until it made u turn to the horizontal portion once this wa dissected out dr x entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy for detail please see his operative note after dr x had completed the resection i then harvested the rectus free flap a skin paddle wa drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm the skin paddle wa incised with the bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath sagittal incision were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle the sheath wa incised to the midline and a small ellipse wa made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin the skin paddle wa then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 30 vicryl the anterior rectus sheath wa then reflected off the rectus muscle which wa then divided superiorly with the bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction the vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion the muscle wa divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle wa dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it wa ligated with two large hemoclips on each vessel the wound wa then packed with saline impregnated sponge the rectus muscle with attached skin paddle wa then transferred into the neck the inferior epigastric artery wa sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 90 ethilon with standard microvascular technique ischemia time wa le than 10 minute likewise the inferior epigastric vein wa sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 90 ethilon a well there wa excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issue with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case the wound wa irrigated with copious amount of saline the eustachian tube wa obstructed with bone wax the muscle wa then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl i removed most the skin of the conchal bowl deepithelializing and leaving the fat in place the wound wa closed in layer overlying the muscle which wa secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull the subcutaneous tissue were closed with interrupted 30 vicryl the skin wa closed with skin staple there wa small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edge were sewn directly to the muscle a to the rectus muscle itself the skin paddle wa closed with interrupted 40 prolene to the edge of the conchal bowl the abdomen wa irrigated with copious amount of saline and the rectus sheath wa closed with # 1 prolene with the more running suture taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractor the subcutaneous tissue were closed with interrupted 20 vicryl and skin wa closed with skin staple the patient wa then turned over to the

second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that wa ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she wa in the early stage of a likely dementia and wa thereafter terminated from her position a a psychiatric nurse a comprehensive evaluation wa requested to ass current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decision and treatment planning note that this evaluation wa undertaken a a clinical exam and intended for the purpose of aiding with treatment planning the patient wa fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the result relevant background information historical information wa obtained from a review of available medical record and clinical interview with the patient a summary of pertinent information is presented below please refer to the patient medical chart for a more complete history history of presenting problem the patient reported that she had worked a a nurse supervisor for hospital center for four year she wa dismissed from this position in september 2009 although she said that she is still under active status technically but is not able to work she continues to receive some compensation through fmla hour she said that she wa told that she had three option to resign to apply for disability retirement and she had 90 day to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employer would file for charge in order for her to be dismissed from state service she said that these 90 day are up around the end of november she said the reason for her dismissal wa performance complaint she said that they began a soon a she arrived and that these were initially related to problem with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor note for any day off she said that her paperwork wa often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workday she described it a a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she wa often putting in extra time she said that since september 2008 she only took two sick day and wa never late to work but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback in july of this year she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she wa being referred to a state medical doctor because she wa unable to perform her job duty and due to excessive sick time following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose record we do not have she wa sent to a neuropsychologist dr y phd he completed a comprehensive independent medical evaluation on 08 14 2009 she said that on 08 27 2009 she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she wa not able to work anymore please note that we do not have copy of any of her workrelated correspondence the patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she wa told that it wa too derogatory a copy of that evaluation wa provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation to summarize the result indicated diagnostically the patient present cognitive deficit involving visual working memory executive functioning and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history this suggests that her intellectual functioning ha declined it concluded that result overall suggest early stage of a likely dementia or possibly the effect of diabetes although her deficit are greater than expected for diabetesrelated executive functioning problem and peripheral neuropathy the patient deficit within

could not be assessed diagnostic study previous diagnostic study and patient report there were extensive patient report all of which were reviewed a previous xray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate an xray of the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55 stenosis the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis there wa no significant stenosis but there wa minor extracranial stenosis noted an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct major vascular occlusion and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration there wa also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis this wa an essentially normal brain mri a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 113 a low red cell count of 343 elevated mch of 324 and the rest of the study wa normal an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which wa low at 127 a calcium which wa low at 83 and a low protein of 52 and albumin of 31 the glucose wa 86 tsh performed in january 2009 wa 157 which is within the normal range vitamin b12 wa greater than a 1000 which is normal and the folate wa 182 which wa normal a myocardial stress study performed in december 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with persantine cardiolite spect the ecg wa nondiagnostic there wa normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle the left ventricular ejection fraction wa 68 which is within the normal range for male a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broadbased disc bulge at l1l2 l2l3 l3l4 and l4l5 at l5s1 in addition to the broadbased disc bulge there wa also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis there wa severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1l4 an echocardiogram wa performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement normal left ventricular systolic function mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy scleral degenerative change in the aortic and mitral apparatus mild mitral regurgitation mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation diagnostic impression the patient present with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory a well a motor finding he is diffusely weak a well a atrophic in all muscle group both in his upper and lower extremity although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremity his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremity signifying that he either ha a severe sensory neuropathy or ha involvement of the dorsal root ganglion according to the history which wa carefully checked the initial onset of these symptom go back one and a half year although there ha only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008 a indicated below further diagnostic study including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory motor and axonal neuropathy and in addition there wa evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy there wa no involvement of the tongue on emg the laboratory testing a indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy we are still however waiting for the paraneoplastic antibody which were send out lab to the mayo clinic this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several condition including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorder such a sle sjogrens rheumatoid arthritis and mixed connective tissue disease in addition it may also be seen with certain toxin particularly chemotherapeutic agent the patient did not receive any of these it may also be seen a part of a paraneoplastic syndrome although the patient doe not have any specific clinical symptom of a cancer it is noted that he ha had an 18pound weight loss in the past month and doe have a remote history of smoking we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation the verbal report of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there wa any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy this wa a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm this showed evidence of severe axonal loss there wa no evidence of a vasculitis the vessel did show some mild intimal change that would be consistent with atherosclerosis there were a few perivascular change however there wa no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple section the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy with evidence of fiber grouping again there wa no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis evaluation so far ha also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy of sarcoidosis and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy specifically there is no history of hiv exposure we would await the result of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibody to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis at this point because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed i have discussed these issue at length with the patient and with his son we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder there is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy and the patient doe not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such a charcotmarietooth disease type 2 however since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two year ago i can not be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this plan 1 nerve conduction and emg will be performed today the result were indicated above 2 the following laboratory study were requested including electrolyte cbc thyroid function test b12 ana creactive protein complement cryoglobulins doublestranded dna antibody folate level hemoglobin a1c immunofixation electrophoresis panca canca protein electrophoresis rheumatoid factor paraneoplastic antibody study requested from the mayo clinic b12 these study showed minor change which included a low sodium level of 129 a previously noted a low creatinine of 074 low calcium of 86 low total protein of 57 the b12 wa greater than 2000 the immunoelectrophoresis ana doublestranded dna anca hemoglobin a1c folate cryoglobulins complement creactive protein were all normal or negative the b12 level wa greater than 2000 liver function test were normal the glucose wa 90 esr wa 10 hemoglobin a1c wa 55 3 a left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted a indicated above 4 ct of chest abdomen and pelvis 5 whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm 6 the patient will go to the rehabilitation facility for acute rehabilitation and training 7 we have not made any change to his medication he doe have some mild orthostatic change however he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 25 mg three time a day a needed up to 5 mg four time a day usually he us a lower dose of 25 three time a day to 5 mg three time a day 8 followup will be a determined by the family,Brain

decreased dexterity of his arm and general fatigue his neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a lengthdependent fashion in his foot and leg with scant fasciculation in his calf he ha fairly normal or very mild increased reflex including notably the presence of normal ankle jerk i think that the etiology of his symptom is multifactorial he probably doe have a mild peripheral neuropathy but the sparing of ankle jerk suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such a a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy he really is most concerned about the fatigue and i think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea whether he ha another underlying muscular disorder such a a primary myopathy remains to be seen recommendation 1 i scheduled him for repeat emg and nerve conduction study to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy 2 i will review his film at our spine conference tomorrow although i am confident in dr z opinion that there is no surgical indication 3 i gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training a well a treatment for his neck pain 4 i believe that he need to undergo psychotherapy for his depression it may also be worthwhile to adjust his medication but i will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist the patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion 5 he doe need to have his sleep apnea better controlled he state that he is not

and wa given an epidural anesthetic i do not have the record from this hospital admission but apparently the epidural wa administered for approximately 14 to 18 hour she wa sitting up during the epidural she did not notice any difference in her lower extremity at the time she had the epidural however she report that she wa extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremity at that time she delivered on the 31st of october by cesarean section because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia she also had a foley catheter placed at that time on the 1st of november 2008 they began to mobilize her and it wa at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk she wa aware that she could not move her leg at all and then within a few day she wa aware that she could move toe in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all since that time there ha been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now ha limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg she is not able to walk by herself and need assistance to stand she wa discharged from hospital after the cesarean section on the 3rd of november unfortunately we do not have the record and we do not know what the discussion wa between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge she wa then seen at abc hospital on november 05 2008 she had an mri scan of her spine which showed no evidence of an abnormality specifically there were no cord change and no evidence of a hematoma she also had an emg study at that time by dr x which wa abnormal but not diagnostic and this wa repeated again in december at the present time she also complains of a pressure in both her leg and in her thigh she complains that her right foot hurt and that she ha some hyperesthesia there she ha been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort although she is on a very low dose and the effect is

level to light touch at approximately t7 posteriorly and approximately t9 anteriorly there wa a range of sensation but clearly there wa a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation to pain the sensory level is even le clear but appeared to be at about t7 on the right side in the lower extremity there wa a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left there wa no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia joint position sense wa mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left coordination coordination for rapid alternating movement and fingertonose testing wa normal coordination could not be tested in the lower extremity gait the patient wa unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or romberg there wa no evidence of focal back tenderness review of outside record i have reviewed the record from abc hospital including the letter from dr y and the emg report dated 12 17 2008 from dr x the emg report show evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately t6 the lower extremity sensory response are essentially normal however there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor response with minimal change in latency i do have the mri of lumbar spine report from 11 06 2008 with and without contrast this showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of l4l5 without disc herniation but wa otherwise unremarkable the patient brought a disc with a most recent mri study however we were unable to open this on our computer the verbal report is that the study wa unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve root a doppler of the lower extremity showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity chest xray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine curve to the left but no evidence of other abnormality a ct pelvis study performed on november 07 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back posterior to l4 and l5 level however there were no pelvic mass or other abnormality we were able to obtain an update of the report from the mri of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12 30 2008 the complete study included the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine there wa diffuse enhancement of the nerve root of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in november it wa also reported that the patient wa given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremity impression the patient ha a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she wa given at the end of october 2008 prior to her cesarean section it appears she became aware of weakness within two day of the administration of the epidural she wa very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function she wa severely weak in both lower extremity slightly worse on the right than the left there ha been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of november 2008 her emg study from the end of december is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy the mri finding of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve root would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural there had been no response to iv methylprednisolone given to her at abc the issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cell or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both abc and by myself the patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concern that this might worsen her condition at the present time she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk there is no evidence on her previous emg of a demyelinating neuropathy recommendation 1 the diagnostic issue were discussed with the patient at length she is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two year although it is unclear a to how much function she will regain 2 she is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy and to continue with the plan to mobilize her a much a possible with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory if she is able to walk she will need bilateral afos for her ankle to improve her overall mobility i am not prescribing these because at the present time she doe not need them 3 we discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin the paresthesia that she ha may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function although there is a concern that a recovery continues she may be left with significant neuropathic pain if this is the case i have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg bid gradually up to 300 mg four time a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four time a day she may need other neuropathic pain medication a needed she will determine whether her current symptom are significant enough to require this increase in dosage 4 the patient will follow up with dr y and his team at abc hospital she will also

operative finding this patient had a 3cm acoustic neuroma the tumor wa incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem at 005 milliampere at the conclusion of the dissection procedure in detail following induction of adequate general anesthetic the patient wa positioned for surgery she wa placed in a lateral position and her head wa maintained with mayfield pin the left periauricular area wa shaved prepped and draped in the sterile fashion transdermal electrode for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed and no response wa verified the proposed incision wa injected with 1 xylocaine with epinephrine next tshaped incision wa made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease the incision wa undermined at the level of temporalis fascia and the portion of the fascia wa harvested for further use incision wa made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip periosteal elevator wa used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone emissary vein posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax bergen retractor were used to maintain exposure using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy wa performed the sigmoid sinus wa identified anteriorly and the transverse site were identified superiorly from these structure approximately 4 x 4 cm a window of bone wa removed bone shaving were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use the bone flap wa also left at the site for further use dissection wa extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base bone wax wa used to occlude air cell lateral to the sigmoid sinus there wa extensively aerated temporal bone at this point dr trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor the cerebellum wa retracted away from the tumor and the retractor wa placed to help maintain exposure once initial exposure wa completed attention wa directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone the dura wa excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone then using diamond bur the internal auditory canal wa dissected out the bone wa removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm there wa considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal a well the dura wa then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor wa difficult therefore dr trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portion of the tumor with dissection he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem the eighth nerve wa identified and transected tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem the facial nerve wa difficult to identify at the brainstem a well it wa identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time wa the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this wa difficult to achieve attention wa then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor wa removed the superior and inferior vestibular nerve were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus at this point plane of dissection wa again indistinct the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated the tumor wa further debulked and thinned but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor the nerve could be stimulated but wa quite splayed over the anterior face further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempt were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve both proximally and distally however the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve wa not usually delineated however the tumor wa then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness it wa released from the brainstem ventrally the tumor wa then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 005 milliampere overall the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume at this point dr trask reinspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis the air cell around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax a piece of fascia wa then laid over the bone defect next the dura wa closed with duragen and duraseal the bone flap and bone were then placed in the bone defect postauricular musculature wa then reapproximated using interrupted 30 vicryl suture the skin wa also closed using interrupted subdermal 30 vicryl suture running 40 nylon suture wa placed at the skin level sterile mastoid dressing

caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that wa within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum the ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor and this wa draining csf relieving pressure in the posterior fossa upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region the brain wa noted to be extremely tight thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy at the posterior fossa a corticectomy wa accomplished and the tumor wa countered directly the tumor a the one above wa removed both piecemeal and with intraoperative cavitron ultrasonic aspirator a gross total excision of this tumor wa obtained a well i then explored underneath the cerebellum in hope of finding another metastasis in the cp angle however this wa just over the lower cranial nerve and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscle and voice a well a possibly hearing loss this lesion wa left alone and to be radiated and that it is le than 3 cm in diameter meticulous hemostasis wa obtained for this wound a well the posterior fossa wound wa

2948,reason for visit the patient is an 84yearold man who return for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus he is accompanied by his wife and daughter history of present illness i first saw him nearly a year ago on december 20 2007 at that time he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight month this included severe cognitive impairment gait impairment and incontinence he had actually been evaluated at hospital with csf drainage via a temporary spinal catheter but there wa no response that wa noted when i saw him there were finding consistent with cervical stenosis and i ordered an mri scan of the cervical spine i subsequently referred him to dr x who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on july 16 2008 according to his note this went well according to the family there ha not been any improvement with regard to the gait and balance they actually think that he is worse now than he wa a year ago he is virtually unable to walk at all he need both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk therefore he is always in the wheelchair he is completely incontinent he never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom on the other hand when asked he will indicate that he need to go he wear a depends undergarment all the time he ha no headache his thinking and memory are worse for the most part he is apathetic he doe not talk very much he life in a skilled nursing facility in the alzheimers section he doe have some daytime activity he take a nap once a day he doe not read very much on the other hand he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election he need full assistance at the nursing home medication from the list by the nursing home are aricept 10 mg in the evening carbidopa levodopa 25 100 mg three time a day citalopram celexa 40 mg daily colace 100 mg twice a day finasteride proscar 5 mg once a day flomax tamsulosin 04 mg once a day multivitamin with iron once a day omeprazole prilosec 20 mg once a day senna 86 mg twice a day tylenol 650 mg a needed and promethazine 25 mg a needed physical exam on examination today this is a pleasant 81yearold man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair he is well developed well nourished and kempt vital sign temperature 967 pulse 62 respiration 16 and blood pressure 123 71 head the head is normocephalic and atraumatic mental status assessed for orientation recent and remote memory attention span concentration language and fund of knowledge the minimental state exam score wa 14 30 he wa not at all oriented he did know we were at sinai hospital on the second floor he could spell world forward but wa mute when asked to spell backwards he wa mute when asked to recall 3 3 object for delayed recall he could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagon for comparison the minimental state exam score last december wa 20 30 when attention wa tested by having him spell world backwards and 28 30 when tested with serial 7 subtraction additionally there are time when he stutter or stammer i do not see any paraphasic error there is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia he is also stimulus bound there is a tendency to mimic cranial nerve exam there is no upgaze that i can elicit today the horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact this is a change from a year ago the muscle of facial expiration are intact a are hearing head turning cough tongue and palate movement motor exam normal bulk and strength the tone is characterized by paratonia there is no atrophy fasciculation drift or tremor sensory exam intact to light touch cerebellar exam intact for fingertonose testing that he can perform only by mimicking but not by following verbal command gait severely impaired when in the wheelchair he lean to one side he can not getup on his own he need assistance once up he can bear weight but can not maintain his balance this would amount to a tinetti score of zero review of xrays i personally reviewed the ct scan of the brain from november 1 2008 and compared it to the mri scan from a year ago the ventricle appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago the frontal horn span is now 6 cm whereas previously it wa about 55 cm the 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm there is no obvious atrophy although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy the scan from a year ago showed that there wa a patent sylvian aqueduct assessment the patient ha had worsening of his gait his dementia and his incontinence the new finding for me today is the limited upgaze this would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy which wa one of the differential diagnosis a year ago or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricle problem diagnosis 1 question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus 3315 2 possible supranuclear palsy 3 severe gait impairment 4 urinary urgency and incontinence 5 dementia plan i had a long talk with him and his family even though he ha already had a trial of csf drainage via spinal catheter at hospital over a year ago i offered this test to them again i do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricle on the scan his family and i discussed the fact that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptom that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference i have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed i gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including it rationale risk benefit and alternative i specifically mentioned the 3 chance of infection which mean a 97 chance of no infection,Brain

note an uncomfortable stiffness in her foot and slight swelling of the ankle apparently the swelling wa not visible by others she saw multiple physician and wa told that it wa not arthritis but no definite diagnosis wa ever established she saw at least two rheumatologist on several occasion and blood test were all normal no clearcut diagnosis wa ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptom however over time she noted that the symptom in her leg seemed to worsen somewhat she state from timetotime she could barely walk she felt a if her balance is impaired and she felt a if she were walking on stilt she tried arch support from a podiatrist without any benefit she began to tire more easily when walking in 2002 she wa seen by a podiatrist who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist in the fall of 2002 she wa seen by dr x he ordered an mri scan of her brain and lumbar spine he also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing after reviewing everything he diagnosed multiple sclerosis however prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy he referred her for a second opinion to dr y in january of 2003 dr y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis the patient then returned to dr x and wa started on avonex she continued on it for about six month however it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it she also recalled being tried on baclofen by dr x but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy so she discontinued it also at that point in time she decided to try a program of good nutrition vitamin supplement and fish oil in december 2004 and extending up to february 2005 she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremity she began to have to use a cane she wa seen in neurological consultation by dr z she wa treated with a medrol dosepak her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically however within about two week symptom were back to baseline she wa then treated with intravenous solumedrol 500 mg daily for five day followed by a prednisone or medrol taper july 2005 this seemed to be le helpful than the oral steroid but wa partially beneficial however it wore off once again a repeat mri scan of the brain in april 2005 wa said to look better she wa started on zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit finally six day ago she wa restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablet she take onehalf tablet daily and this again ha seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her leg she continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity she ha not been on any other immunomodulatory agent the patient doe note some complaint of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability there is no history of diplopia dysarthria aphasia focal weakness numbness paresthesia cognitive dysfunction or memory dysfunction past

renal artery up on consideration of various modality and therapy the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy procedure in detail the patient wa verified by armband and the procedure being roboticassisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy wa verified and the procedure wa carried out after institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotic the patient wa positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated great care wa taken to pad all pressure point and a right arm hanger wa used the patient wa flexed slightly and a kidney rest wa used sequential compression device were also placed next the patient wa prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidoneiodine pneumoperitoneum wa obtained by placing a veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test a low pressure high flow pneumoperitoneum wa adequately obtained using co2 gas next a 12mm camera port wa placed near the umbilicus the camera wa inserted and no bowel injury wa seen next under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera port a 12 mm assist port a 5 mm liver retraction port and 5 mm assist port were placed the robot wa docked and the instrument passed through respective check initial attention wa directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially next the right lateral duodenum wa cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum at this point the right kidney wa in clear view and the fascia wa entered initial attention wa directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which wa done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection it became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessel one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole these artery were dissected carefully and vessel loop were applied next a small hole wa then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the content of the renal pelvis were suctioned out the pyelotomy wa extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected sequentially each major calyx wa inspected under direct vision and irrigated a total of four round kidney stone were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient at this point we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which wa dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis the proximal ureter wa spatulated using cold scissors next redundant renal pelvis wa excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section we then identified the most inferior dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteralrenal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion 30 monocryl suture were used to reanastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis next remainder of the pyelotomy wa closed to itself also using 20 monocryl suture before final stitch were placed a 6x28 ureteral stent wa placed anterograde this wa accomplished by placing the stent over a guidewire placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter this wa done until the proximal end wa in the renal pelvis the guidewire wa removed and good proximal curl wa verified by direct vision then the pyelotomy wa completely closed again with 20 monocryl suture next attention wa directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge le upon the renal pelvis good pulsation wa verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy suture next gerotas fascia wa reapproximated and closed with vicryl suture a wa the right peritoneum hemostasis appeared excellent at this point there wa no obvious urine extravasation at this time the procedure wa terminated the robot wa undocked under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm port were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl suture in an interrupted fashion then all skin port site were closed with 40 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and bandaids were applied over this also notably a jacksonpratt drain wa placed in the

long discussion with the patient her husband i think it is possible that the patient is developing symptomatic adult hydrocephalus at this point her symptom are fairly mild i explained to them the two method of testing with csf drainage it is possible that a large volume lumbar puncture would reveal whether she is likely to respond to shunt and i described that test about 30 of my patient with walking impairment in a setting of possible adult hydrocephalus can be diagnosed with a large volume lumbar puncture alternatively i could bring her into the hospital for four day of csf drainage to determine whether she is likely to respond to shunt surgery this procedure carry a 2 to 3 risk of meningitis i also explained that it would be reasonable to start with an outpatient lumbar puncture

vein were identified on the right side and elevated the space between the ureter and the gonadal vein wa then developed and the gonadal vein wa dropped elevating only the ureter and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum once we got up to the renal hilum we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessel partially and in particular we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a satinsky clamp or bulldog the remainder of the kidney wa then freed off it lateral and superior attachment primarily using the harmonic scalpel and the ligasure device with the kidney free and the hilum prepared the gerota fascia wa taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma and using this approach we were able to identify the 2cm right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally a cap of fat wa left overlying this mass based on the position of the mass we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated based on this finding i decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection a satinsky clamp wa introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure and he also received lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum with the renal hilum clamped we did resect the tumor using cold scissors there wa somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping however we were able to successfully resect this lesion we also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table a a specimen for frozen section with the tumor resected the base of the resection wa then cauterized using the argon beam coagulator and several bleeding vessel were oversewn using figureofeight 30 vicryl suture with lap tie for tensioning we then placed a floseal into the wound and covered it with a surgicel and held the pressure we then released the vascular clamp total clamp time wa 11 minute there wa minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver and after unclamping the kidney the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp we then replaced the kidney within it gerota envelope and closed that with 30 vicryl using lap tie for tensioning a jp drain wa introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 20 nylon the specimen wa placed into a 10mm endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm it wa evaluated on the table and passed off the table for pathology to evaluate they stated that the tumor wa close to the margin but there appeared to be 12 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor in addition the frozen section biopsy from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma based on these finding the lower most trocar site wa closed using a running 0 vicryl suture in the fascia we then reinsufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis any bleeding point were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips the area wa copiously irrigated with normal saline the colon wa then replaced into it normal anatomic position the mesentry wa evaluated there were no defect noted we closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a carterthompson closure device with 0vicryl all trocars were removed under direct visualization and the abdomen wa desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar the skin incision were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 025 marcaine and the skin

localized area of pain and edema diagnosis the subject had rectal culture obtained which were positive for neisseria gonorrhoeae an hiv elisa wa positive a wa the rna pcr discussion this patient demonstrates a number of key issue to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult first the patient utilized the emergency department for care a opposed to identifying a primary care provider although not ideal in many circumstance testing for hiv infection is crucial when there is suspicion since many newly diagnosed patient identify earlier contact with health care provider when hiv counseling and testing were not performed second this young man ha had both male and female sexual partner a young people explore their sexuality asking about partner in an open nonjudgmental manner without applying label is integral to helping the young person discus their sexual behavior assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have samesex attraction third screening for std must take into account sexual behavior although urinebased screening ha expanded testing of young people it miss anal and pharyngeal infection if a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse urine screening is insufficient to rule out std fourth this young man had both localized and systemic symptom a his anal symptom were most suggestive of a current std performing an hiv test should be part of the standard evaluation in addition a acute infection is on the differential diagnosis pcr testing should also be considered the care provided to this young man included the following he wa treated presumptively for proctitis with both im ceftriaxone a well a oral doxycycline to treat n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis ceftriaxone wa chosen due to

impressive but we do not have this result despite calling medical record in the hospital to release this information assessment and plan the patient is a 55yearold with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis unknown cause 1 epigastric pain the patient had chronic pain syndrome he had multiple back surgery and he ha taken opiate for a prolonged period of time in the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam his pain doe not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episode of abdominal pain almost continuously he probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiate which should be addressed with his primary care physician 2 endstage liver disease of course we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis we do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which wa performed before we do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past again patient wa seen by gastroenterologist already in la crux dr x the patient wa advised to contact dr x by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result it will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary test in that point in time we are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alphafetoprotein level we will also need to get information about ultrasound which wa done in gila medical center but obviously no tumor wa found on this exam of the liver we have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he need vaccination against hepatitis a and b until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient endstage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis c the patient denied any excessive alcohol intake but i could not preclude alcoholrelated liver cirrhosis also we will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before psc is extremely unlikely but possible wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again we first have to figure out if these test were done for the patient or not alpha1antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient

his heart rate will drop to 25 from 75 to probably 6058 the patient wa educated how to use inderal and he wa explained why we decided to use this medication the patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic again the patient and his wife were advised to contact all office they have seen before to get information about what test were already done and if on the next visit in 2

indication this is a 63yearold white male patient with multiple medical problem including hypertension diabetes endstage renal disease coronary artery disease and the patient is on hemodialysis who ha had recurrent episode of epigastric right upper quadrant pain the patient wa found to have cholelithiasis on last admission he wa being worked up for this including cardiac clearance however in the interim he returned again with another episode of same pain the patient had a hida scan done yesterday which show nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction because of these laparoscopic cholecystectomy wa advised with cholangiogram possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure wa also explained to the patient the procedure indication risk and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent wa obtained description of procedure the patient wa put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia the entire abdomen wa prepped and draped a small transverse incision wa made about 21 2 inch above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia the patient ha a rather long torso fascia wa opened vertically and stay suture were placed in the fascia peritoneal cavity wa carefully entered hasson cannula wa inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it wa insufflated with co2 laparoscopic camera wa inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area the patient wa placed in reverse trendelenburg and rotated to the left an 11mm trocar wa placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5mm in the right subcostal region slowly the dissection wa carried out in the right subhepatic area initially i wa able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver then some inflammatory change were noted with some fatty necrosis type of change and it wa not quite clear whether this wa part of the gallbladder or it wa just pericholecystic infection inflammation the visualization wa extremely difficult because of the patient obesity and a lot of fat intraabdominally although his abdominal wall is not that thick after evaluating this for a little while we decided that there wa no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy the trocars were removed a right subcostal incision wa made and peritoneal cavity wa entered a bookwalter retractor wa put in place the dissection wa then carried out on the undersurface of the liver eventually the gallbladder wa identified which wa markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it dissection wa further carried down to what wa felt to be the common bile duct which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size the duodenum wa kocherized the gallbladder wa partly intrahepatic because of this i decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem the inferior wall of the gallbladder wa opened and two large stone one wa about 3 cm long and another one about 15 x 2 cm long were taken out of the gallbladder it wa difficult to tell where the cystic duct wa eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder i did find the cystic duct which wa relatively very short intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram wa done using carm fluoroscopy this showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone at this time a decision wa made to proceed with common duct exploration the common duct wa opened between stay suture of 40 vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out after some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct so it wa about a 1cm size stone which wa removed following this a 10french red rubber catheter wa passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously no further stone were obtained the catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of vater at this point a choledochoscope wa inserted and proximally i did not see any evidence of any common duct stone or proximally into the biliary tree however a stone wa found distally still floating around this wa removed with stone forceps the bile duct were irrigated again no further stone were removed a 16french ttube wa then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct wa repaired around the ttube using 40 vicryl interrupted suture obtaining watertight closure a completion ttube cholangiogram wa done at this time which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct although externally i wa unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area because of this the ttube wa removed and i passed the choledochoscope proximally again and i wa unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area i felt at this time this wa most likely an impression from the outside which wa still left over a gallbladder where the stone wa stuck and it wa impressing on the bile duct the bile duct lumen wa widely open ttube wa again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion ttube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time the cystic duct opening through which i had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram this wa closed with a figureofeight suture of 20 vicryl and this wa actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area the remaining gallbladder bed which wa left in situ wa cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic space were irrigated with sterile saline solution hemostasis wa good a 10mm jacksonpratt drain wa left in the foramen of winslow and brought out through the lateral 5mm port site the

would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age referring to the database that had been online she ha a 13 chance of relapse in the next five year and with aggressive chemotherapy xlinked agammaglobulinemia xla platinumbased this would be reduced to an 8 risk of relapse with a 5 benefit chemotherapy with 5fu based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 25 plan wa made

anesthesia general indication the patient is an unfortunate 6monthold baby boy who ha been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites the patient ha been treated somewhat successfully with tpn and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition but he had repeated chylothoraces last week dr x took the patient to the operating room in hope that with thoracotomy a thoracic duct leak could be found which would be successfully closed surgically however at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what wa discovered wa a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen dr x opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole this wa closed and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration a a last stage effort would allow u to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease we met with his parent and talked to them about this and he is here today for that attempt operative finding the patient abdomen wa relatively soft minimally distended exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity what we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax wa a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two third to three quarter of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum the cecum and the portion of the ascending colon it appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery there wa about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved but i did not think that resection of three quarter of the patient small bowel would be viable surgical option instead we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that the lymphatic abnormality wa extensive they were linear dilated lymphatic channel on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery they were small aneurysmlike pocket of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structure and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel a well no other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure wa identified both indirect inguinal hernia were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect a well description of operation the patient wa brought from the pediatric intensive care unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feed established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow we conducted a surgical timeout and reiterated all of the patient important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan a described above preparation and draping of his abdomen wa done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscle and all layer of the abdominal wall fascia a the peritoneal cavity wa entered we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between vicryl tie and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described the bowel wa eviscerated and then with careful inspection we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that wa a source of the patient chylous ascites the small bowel from the ligament of treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum wa largely unaffected but did not appear that resection of 75 of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for the patient but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problem furthermore it might burn bridge necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option we suctioned free all of the chylous accumulation replaced the intestine to their peritoneal cavity and then closed the patient abdominal incision with 40 pd on the posterior sheath and 30 pd on the anterior rectus sheath subcuticular 50 monocryl and steristrips were used for skin closure the patient tolerated the procedure well he lost minimal blood but did lose approximately 100 ml of chylous fluid from the abdomen that wa suctioned free a part of the chylous ascitic leak the patient wa returned to the pediatric intensive care unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an intestinal transplantation center to see if that is an option for the patient because he ha no universally satisfactory medical

4643,preoperative diagnosis empyema of the left chest and consolidation of the left lung postoperative diagnosis empyema of the left chest consolidation of the left lung lung abscess of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe operative procedure left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscess and multiple biopsy of pleura and lung anesthesia general finding the patient ha a complex history which go back about four month ago when she started having respiratory symptom and one week ago she wa admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two cat scan of chest she wa found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with a questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax there wa also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung the patient had a 30year history of cigarette smoking a chest tube wa placed at the other hospital which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor actually what wa thought to be a fecallike odor then an abdominal ct scan wa done which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormality in the abdomen on the abdominal ct the patient wa started on antibiotic and wa then taken to the operating room where there wa to be a thoracoscopy performed the patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesion but there wa bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this wa suctioned out this wa suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline in the bronchus following the bronchoscopy a double lumen tube wa placed but it wa not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day the patient wa transferred for continued evaluation and treatment today the double lumen tube wa placed and there wa some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airway in the bronchus and also remarkably bloody secretion were also noted these were suctioned but it wa enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus eventually the double lumen tube wa secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy wa performed after the chest tube wa removed and digital dissection wa carried out through that the chest tube tract which wa about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space but it wa not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract a second incision for thoracoscopy wa made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection wa carried out but it wa not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity therefore the chest wa opened and remarkable finding included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it wa very hard and firm throughout remarkably the surface of the lower lobe laterally wa not completely covered with a fibrotic line but it wa more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe there were many pocket of purulent material which had a graywhite appearance to it there wa quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe the adhesion were taken down and they were quite bloody in some area indicating that the process had been present for some time there seemed to be an abscess that wa about 3 cm in dimension all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube wa placed many culture were taken from several area the most remarkable finding wa a large cavity which wa probably about 11 cm in dimension containing grayish pu and also caseouslike material it wa thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity the apex of the lung wa quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesion were quite thickened and firm procedure and technique with the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest wa prepped and draped in sterile manner the chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection wa carried out through the old chest tube tract but then it wa necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the thoracoport in place and this wa done and a mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this therefore the next incision for thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port wa over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization wa achieved but it wa clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision wa made entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection wa performed to take down adhesion to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity specimen for culture were taken and specimen for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense suture ligature of prolene were required when the cavity wa encountered it wa due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified a a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it wa opened it wa quite large and we unroofed it completely and there wa bleeding down in the depth of the cavity which appeared to be from pulmonary vein and these were sutured with a tissue pledget of what wa probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with prolene suture also a the upper lobe wa retracted in caudal direction the tissue wa quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side wa torn and for hemostasis a 14french foley catheter wa passed into the area of the tear and the balloon wa inflated which helped establish hemostasis and suturing wa carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what wa probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this wa sutured in place and the foley catheter wa removed the patch wa sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear a similar maneuver wa utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity also on the pulmonary artery repair some material wa used and also thrombin gelfoam and surgicel after reasonably good hemostasis wa established pleural cavity wa irrigated with saline a mentioned biopsy were taken from multiple site on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung then two # 24 blake chest tube were placed one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tube were brought out through stab wound necked into the skin with 0 silk one wa positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex these were later connected to waterseal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure good hemostasis wa observed sponge count wa reported a being correct intercostal nerve block at probably the fifth sixth and seventh intercostal nerve wa carried out then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured end were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragment of this rib metallic clip wa passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture but the bone wa partially fractured inferiorly and it wa very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table so that pericostal suture were used with # 1 vicryl the chest wall wa closed with running # 1 vicryl and then 20 vicryl subcutaneous and staple on the skin the chest tube were connected to waterseal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure sterile dressing were applied the patient tolerated the procedure well and wa turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube wa switched out with single lumen the

4675,preoperative diagnosis and indication acute nonstelevation mi postoperative diagnosis and summary the patient presented with an acute nonstelevation mi despite medical therapy she continued to have intermittent angina angiography demonstrated the severe lad a the culprit lesion this wa treated a noted above with angioplasty alone a the stent could not be safely advanced she ha residual lesion of 75 in the proximal right coronary and 60 proximal circumflex and the other residual lad lesion a noted above she will be continued on her medical therapy at age 90 she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting procedure performed selective coronary angiography coronary angioplasty procedure in detail after informed consent wa obtained the patient wa taken to the cath lab placed on the table in the supine position the area of the right femoral artery wa prepped and draped in a sterile fashion using the percutaneous technique a 6french sheath wa placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance with the guidewire in place a 5french jl4 catheter wa used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system the catheter wa removed the sheath flushed the 5french 3drc catheter wa then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery the cath removed the sheath flushed it wa decided that intervention wa needed in the severe lesion in the lad which appeared to be the culprit lesion for the nonst elevationmi the patient wa given a bolus of heparin and an act of approximately 50 second wa obtained we rebolused and the act wa slightly lower we repeated the level and it wa slightly higher we administered 500 more unit of heparin and then proceeded with an act of approximately 270 second prior to the 500 unit of heparin iv additionally the patient had been given 300 mg of plavix orally during the procedure and integrilin iv bolus and then maintenance drip wa started a 6french cl 35 left coronary guide catheter wa used to cannulate the left main and hew guidewire wa positioned in the distal lad and another hew guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal an apex 25 x 15 mm balloon wa positioned in the distal portion of the mid lad stenosis and inflated to 6 atmosphere for 15 second and then deflated angiography wa then performed demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image wa used for sizing the last of the needed stent the balloon wa pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmosphere for approximately 20 second with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so a to not compromise the ostium the balloon wa inflated and removed repeat angiography performed we attempted to advance a driver 25 x 24 mm bare metal stent but i could not advance it beyond the proximal lad where there wa significant calcification the stent wa removed attempt to advance the same 25 x 15 mm apex balloon that wa previously used were unsuccessful it wa removed a new apex 25 x 15 mm balloon wa then positioned in the proximal lad and inflated to 6 atmosphere for 15 second and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it wa inflated to 6 atmosphere for 15 second and then deflated and removed repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection one more attempt wa made to advance the driver 25 x 24 mm bare metal stent but again i could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal lad and this wa despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal i felt that further attempt in this calcified vessel in a 90yearold with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complication of dissection so the stent wa removed the guidewires and guide cath were removed the sheath flushed and sutured into position the patient moved to icu in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all contrast isovue370 120 ml fluoro time 94 minute estimated blood loss 30 ml hemodynamics aorta 185 54 left ventriculography wa not performed i did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve the left main is a large vessel giving rise to lad and circumflex vessel the left main ha no significant disease other than calcification in the wall the lad is a moderatetolarge vessel giving rise to small diagonal and then a moderatetolarge third diagonal and then a small fourth diagonal the lad ha significant calcification proximally there is a 50 stenosis between the first and second diagonal that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent this resulted in a 30 residual mostly eccentric calcified plaque following this there wa a 50 stenosis in the lad just after the takeoff of the third diagonal this wa not ballooned beyond this is an 80 stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99 stenosis after the fourth diagonal these 2 lesion were dilated with 10 residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25 residual distal to the fourth diagonal a noted above this area wa not stented because i could not safely advance the stent note there wa also a 50 stenosis at the origin of the moderatetolarge third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty the circumflex is a large nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branch the proximal circumflex ha an eccentric 60 stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal the remainder of the vessel wa without significant disease the right coronary wa a large dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and smalltomoderate first posterolateral small second posterolateral and a smalltomoderate third posterolateral

leftsided central shunt on 08 01 2006 he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt a repeat catheterization on 09 25 2001 demonstrated elevated glenn pressure and significant collateral vessel for which he underwent embolization he then underwent repeat catheterization on 11 20 2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessel blood pressure were found to be 13 mmhg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2631 wood unit on 03 22 2004 he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac fontan with placement of an 8mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation a repeat catheterization on 09 07 2006 demonstrated mildly elevated fontan pressure in the context of a widely patent fontan fenestration and intolerance of fontan fenestration occlusion the patient then followed conservatively since that time the patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to ass his candidacy for a fontan fenestration occlusion a well a consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract procedure after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia the patient wa placed under general endotracheal anesthesia the patient wa prepped and draped cardiac catheterization wa performed a outlined in the attached continuation sheet vascular entry wa by percutaneous technique and the patient wa heparinized monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg continuous pulse oximetry and cycled cuff blood pressure in addition to intravascular pressure using a 7french sheath a 6french wedge catheter wa inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery a well a the superior vena cava this catheter wa then exchanged for a 5french v catheter of a distal wire apposition of the right pulmonary artery over which the wedge catheter wa advanced the wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary vein left atrium and left ventricle using a 5french sheath a 5french pigtail catheter wa inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ascending aorta and left ventricle attempt wa then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle the catheter distal wire position wa finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve both angiographically a well a equal guidance left ventricular pressure wa found to be suprasystemic a balloon valvoplasty wa performed using a ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure echocardiogram which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum further angioplasty wa then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7french flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium there wa a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon the balloon catheter wa then removed in it entirety echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve a final angioplasty wa performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste echocardiogram however demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle further attempt to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned attention wa then directed to a fontan fenestration a balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in fontan pressure from 12 mmhg to 15 mmhg with le than 10 fall in

left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary artery there wa communication to the rightsided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery a well a the central pulmonary artery diameter of which wa augmented by the glenn anastomosis and the fontan anastomosis there wa symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary artery a large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration there is competitive flow to the upper lobe presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow the branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic levo phase contrast returned into the heart appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility angiogram with injection in the fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary artery following the device occlusion of fontan fenestration the fontan and

of margin on anterior chest wall adjacent to adherent tumor anesthesia general endotracheal anesthesia with doublelumen endotracheal tube disposition of specimen to pathology both for frozen and permanent analysis finding the right middle lobe tumor wa adherent to the anterior chest wall the adhesion wa taken down and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion wa sent for pathologic analysis the final frozen pathology on this entire area returned a negative for tumor additional chest wall abnormality were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis and these all returned separately a negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue several other biopsy were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall all of the biopsy site were additionally marked with hemoclips the right middle lobe lesion wa accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe estimated blood loss le than 100 ml condition of the patient after surgery stable history of procedure this patient is well known to our service he wa admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control the patient wa subsequently taken to the operating room on april 4 2007 wa given general anesthesia and wa endotracheally intubated without incident although he had markedly difficult airway the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchus no abnormality were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree and based on this the decision wa made to proceed with the surgery the patient wa kept in the supine position and the singlelumen endotracheal tube wa removed and a doublelumen tube wa placed following this the patient wa placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure point were padded sterile duraprep preparation on the right chest wa placed a sterile drape around that wa also placed the table wa flexed to open up the intercostal space a second bronchoscopy wa performed to confirm placement of the doublelumen endotracheal tube marcaine wa infused into all incision area prior to making an incision the incision for the vat right middle lobectomy included a small 1cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula the camera port wa in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5mm 30degree scope wa used third incision wa an anterior port which wa approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space and the third incision wa a utility port which wa a 4 cm long incision which wa approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein all of these incision were eventually created during the procedure the initial incision wa the camera port through which under direct visualization an additional small 5mm port wa created just inferior to the anterior port these two port were used to identify the chest wall lesion which were initially thought to be metastatic lesion multiple biopsy of the chest wall lesion were taken and the decision wa made to also insert the auscultatory incision port through these three incision the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion wa performed multiple biopsy were taken of the entire chest wall offer and specimen came back a negative the right middle lobe wa noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall this area wa taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area wa taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis this also returned a negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocyte within the fibrotic tissue but no tumor cell based on this the decision wa made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy following this the anterior port wa increased in size and the utility port wa made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction wa performed the middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein wa initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45mm endogia stapler following division of the right superior pulmonary vein the right middle lobe bronchus wa easily identified initially this wa thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus but in fact it wa the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus this wa encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45mm endogia following division of this the pulmonary artery wa easily identified two branch of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe these were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp the vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branch successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk and following this an additional branch of the bronchus wa noted to be going to the right middle lobe a fiberoptic bronchoscopy wa performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this wa in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus this wa divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm endogia following division of this the minor and major fissure were completed along the edge of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe a well a the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe following complete division of the fissure the lobe wa put into an endogia bag and taken out through the utility port following removal of the right middle lobe a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling wa performed excising the lymph node package in the 4r area a well a the 7 lymph node package node station 8 or 9 node were easily identified therefore none were taken the patient wa allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted a 19french blake wa placed into the posterior

pacemaker and some lateral twave change not significantly changed from prior followup ekg done this morning show normal sinus rhythm with frequent apc impression she is an 84yearold female with a history of hypertension severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery telemetry now reviewed show predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent apc _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and i suspect that wa exacerbated by prior hypokalemia which ha been corrected there ha been no atrial fibrillation documented i do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath she actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery i feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil which ha been started which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia which she had and would watch for heart rate with that continued optimization of electrolyte the patient can not take betablockers a previously toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath although there wa some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil the patient is aware of the cardiac risk certainly it is moderate and wish to proceed with needed surgery i do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with dr x after discharge regarding her mild thrombocytopenia i would defer that to hospitalist and continue

occasional shortness of breath at rest there ha been some pnd but he sleep on 1 pillow he ha no edema now but ha had some mild leg swelling in the past there ha never been any angina and he denies any palpitation syncope or near syncope when he take his pulse he note some irregularity he follows no special diet he get no regular exercise although he ha recently started walking for half an hour a day over the course of the past year these symptom have been slowly getting worse he gained about 20 pound over the past year there is no prior history of either heart failure or other heart problem his past medical history is remarkable for a right inguinal hernia repair done in 1982 he had trauma to his right thumb there is no history of high blood pressure diabetes mellitus or heart murmur on

mentation is normal his mood and affect are normal he is oriented to person place and time data his ekg show sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy a metabolic stress test show that he wa able to exercise for 5 minute and 20 second to 90 of his maximum predicted heart rate his peak oxygen consumption wa 197 ml kg min which is consistent with mild cardiopulmonary disease laboratory data show his tsh to be 133 his glucose is 97 and creatinine 09 potassium is 43 he is not anemic urinalysis wa normal i reviewed his echocardiogram personally this show a dilated cardiomyopathy with ef of 15 the left ventricular diastolic dimension is 68 cm there are no significant valvular abnormality he had a stress thallium his heart rate response to stress wa appropriate the thallium image showed no scintigraphic evidence of stressinduced myocardial ischemia at 91 of his maximum age predicted heart rate there is a fixed small sized mildtomoderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex which may be an old infarct but certainly doe not account for the degree of cardiomyopathy we got his poststress ef to be 33 and the left ventricular cavity appeared to be enlarged the total calcium score will put him in the 56 percentile for subject of the same age gender and race ethnicity assessment this appears to be a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy the etiology of which is uncertain problem diagnosis 1 dilated cardiomyopathy 2 dyslipidemia procedure and immunization none today plan i started him on an ace inhibitor lisinopril 25 mg daily and a betablocker carvedilol 3125 mg twice daily the dose of these drug should be uptitrated every 2 week to a target dose of lisinopril of 20 mg daily and carvedilol 25 mg twice daily in addition he could benefit from a loop diuretic such a furosemide i did not start this a he is planning to go back home to san salvador tomorrow i will leave that up to his local physician to uptitrate the medication and get him started on some furosemide in term of the dilated cardiomyopathy there is not much further that need to be done except for family screening all of his sibling and his child should have an ekg and an echocardiogram to make sure they have not developed the same thing there is a strong genetic component of this i will see him again in 3 to 6 month whenever he can make it back here he doe not need a defibrillator right now and my plan would be to get him on the right dos of the right medication and then recheck an echocardiogram 3 month later if his lv function ha not improved he doe have new

catheter wa inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place there wa good blood return from both the port using a 4french sheath a 4french wedge catheter wa inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structure out to the branch of pulmonary artery the atrial septum wa not probe patent using a 4french sheath a 4french marker pigtail catheter wa inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ascending aorta and left ventricle a descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery the transverse arch measured 5 mm isthmus measured 47 mm and coarctation measured 29 x 18 mm at the descending aorta level the diaphragm measured 56 mm the pigtail catheter wa exchanged for a wedge catheter which wa then directed into the right innominate artery this catheter wa exchanged over a wire for a tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which wa advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist pressure pullback following angioplasty however demonstrated a residual of 1520 mmhg gradient repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing the angioplasty wa then performed using a tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist the pigtail catheter wa then reintroduced for a pressure pullback measurement and final angiogram flow were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta after angiography two normalappearing renal collecting system were visualized the catheter and sheath were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis the patient wa returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition there were no complication discussion oxygen consumption wa assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation wa low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia there is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt further the heart wa desaturated due to vq mismatch phasic rightsided pressure were normal a wa the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the awave similar to the normal left ventricular enddiastolic pressure of 12 mmhg left ventricular systolic pressure wa mildly increased with a 60 mmhg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmhg systolic gradient on pressure pullback to the descending aorta the calculated flow were mildly increased vascular resistance were normal a cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origin of the brachiocephalic vessel there is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta flow within the intercostal artery wa retrograde following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta there wa slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation a the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmhg to 92 mmhg there remained a 4 mmhg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmhg systolic gradient pressure pullback to the descending aorta the calculated systemic flow fell to normal value final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus there is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal artery the narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 49 x 42 mm diagnosis 1 juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta 2 dilated cardiomyopathy 3 bicuspid aortic valve 4 patent foramen ovale intervention balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta management the case will be discussed at combined cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery case conference the patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hope of complete left ventricular function recovery the patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically

aortogram 7 percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal branch with plano balloon angioplasty unable to pas stent narrative after all risk and benefit were explained to the patient informed consent wa obtained the patient wa brought to the cardiac catheterization suite the right groin wa prepped in the usual sterile fashion right common femoral artery wa cannulated using a modified seldinger technique and a long 6french ao sheath wa introduced secondary to tortuous aorta next judkins left catheter wa used to engage the left coronary system cineangiography wa recorded in multiple view next judkins right catheter wa used to engage the right coronary system cineangiography wa recorded in multiple view next the judkins right catheter wa used to engage the svg to om cineangiography wa recorded next the judkins right wa advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length jwire for a 4french left internal mammary artery which wa used to engage the lima graft to lad and cineangiography wa recorded in multiple view next an angled pigtail catheter wa advanced into the left ventricular cavity lv pressure were measured lv gram wa done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve wa done and recorded next an aortogram wa done and recorded at this point i decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex therefore ava 35 guide wa used to engage the left coronary artery angiomax bolus and drip wa started universal wire wa advanced past the lesion and a 25balloon wa advanced first to the proximal lesion and predilations were done at 14 atmosphere and then to the distal lesion and predilatation wa done at 12 atmosphere next we attempted to advance a 30 x 12 stent to the distal lesion however we were unable to pas the stent next second dilatation were done again with the 25 balloon at 18 atmosphere however we are unable to break the lesion we next attempted a cutting balloon again we are unable to cross the lesion therefore a buddy wire technique wa used with a pt choice support wire again we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent we then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon which we were unsuccessful we also try to cutting balloon again we were unsuccessful despite multiple dilatation we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion therefore finally the procedure wa aborted final image showed no evidence of dissection perforation or further complication the right groin wa filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent result the patient tolerated the procedure very well without complication wa taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor diagnostic finding 1 the lv lvedp wa 4 lf is approximately 5055 with inferobasal hypokinesis no significant mr no gradient across the aortic valve 2 aortogram the ascending aorta show no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection the valve show no significant aortic insufficiency the abdominal aorta and distal aorta show significant tortuosity 3 the left main the left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel bifurcating the lad and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 1020 4 left circumflex the left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel give off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch the upper pole of the om show retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 7080 stenosis the mid left circumflex is a highgrade 80 diffuse tortuous stenosis 5 lad the lad is a totally 100 occluded vessel the lima to lad is patent with only a smalltomoderate caliber lad there is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the lad and that proximal lad showed some diffuse disease upwards of 6070 the diagonal show proximal 80 stenosis 6 the right coronary artery the right coronary artery is 100 occluded there are retrograde collateral from left to right to the distal pda and plv branch the svg to om is 100 occluded at it take off the svg to pda is not found however presumed 100 occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right 7 lima to lad is widely patent assessment and plan attempted intervention to the left circumflex system only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty unable to pas stent noncompliant balloon or cutting balloon final image showed some improvement however continued residual stenosis at this point the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored we can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management the patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal however due to the length of this procedure i did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch possible consideration would be a stress test a an outpatient depending on where patient show ischemia focus on treatment to that lesion,Heart

atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12lead ekg here otherwise no chest pain past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more

initial ecg show atrial flutter impression mr a is a 50yearold gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogramguided cardioversion for him in late 12 20 09 who now ha another recurrence within the past 41 hour or so i have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risk benefit and alternative of proceeding with cardioversion which the patient is in favor of after in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with le longterm side effect past the acute procedure alternative being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and or heart rate control with anticoagulation which the patient wa not interested nor wa i primarily recommending a the next step and risk including but not limited to and the patient wa aware and this wa all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an allinclusive list but the risk include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach content which would be le likely a i did confirm with the patient that he had been npo for greater than 15 hour risk of induction of other arrhythmia including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joule he did have a 55second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy statistically le significant risk of cva although we can not really make that null the patient expressed understanding of this risk benefit and alternative analysis i invited question from him and his wife and once their question were answered to their selfstated satisfaction we planned to go forward with the procedure procedure note the patient received a total of 7 mg of versed and 50 microgram of fentanyl utilizing titratedown sedation with good effect and this wa after the appropriate timeout procedure had been done a per the medical center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient position procedure documentation procedure indication and there were no question the patient did actively participate in this timeout procedure after the universal protocol wa done he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joule using lollipop posterior patch with handsdriven paddle on the side which wa 50 joule of synchronized biphasic energy there wa successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm in fact this time there wa not a significant pause a compared to when he had this done previously in late 12 09 and this sinus rhythm wa confirmed by a 12lead ekg impression cardioversion show successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient ha been maintained on coumadin and his inr is 322 we are going to watch him and discharge him from the medical center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening atenolol 25 mg once a day coumadin _____ a currently being diagnosed i had previously discussed with the patient and he wa agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again dr x at electrophysiology unit at general hospital and i will be planning to place a call for dr x myself again he ha no ischemia on this most recent stress test and i suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptom i had previously discussed the case with dr y who is the patient general cardiologist a well a

4909,reason for referral cardiac evaluation and treatment in a patient who came in the hospital with abdominal pain history this is a 77yearold white female patient whom i have known for the last about a year or so who ha underlying multiple medical problem including hypertension hyperlipidemia diabetes mellitus coronary artery disease status post aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight year ago at halifax medical center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary artery since then she ha generally done well she used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in september 2008 and she wa otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography but the patient declined to have one done and since then she ha been on medical therapy the patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well recently she had no leg swelling undue exertional dyspnea orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea she denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort yesterday evening she had her dinner and she wa sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 700 pm the discomfort wa a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it wa off and on lasting for a few minute at a time and then subsiding later on she wa nauseous but she did not have any vomiting she denied any diarrhea no history of fever or chill since the pain seemed to persist the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 1135 pm where she wa seen and admitted for the same she wa given morphine zofran demerol another zofran and reglan a well a demerol again and she wa given intravenous fluid subsequently her pain finally went away and she doe not have any pain since about 700 am this morning the patient wa admitted however for further workup and treatment at the time of my examination this afternoon the patient is sitting lying in bed and comfortable and ha no abdominal pain of any kind she ha not been fed any food however the patient also had had pelvis and abdominal ct scan performed which ha been described to be partial small bowel obstruction internal hernia volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area the patient ha had left nephrectomy and splenectomy which ha been described a 15mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney the patient also ha been described to have diverticulosis without diverticulitis on this finding currently however the patient ha no clinical symptom according to her past medical history she ha had hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 15 year diabetes mellitus for the last eight year and coronary artery disease for last about eight year or so she had a chest and back pain about eight year ago for about two week and then subsequently she wa reported to be evaluated she ha a small myocardial infarction and then she wa under the care of dr a and she had aortocoronary bypass surgery at halifax medical center by dr b which wa a threevessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and distal right coronary artery respectively she had had nuclear stress test with dr c on september 3 2008 which wa described to be abnormal with ischemic defect but i do not think the patient had any further cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography after that she ha been treated medically this patient also had an admission to this hospital in may 2008 also for partial small bowel obstruction and cholelithiasis and sigmoid diverticulosis she wa described to have had a hemorrhagic cyst of the right kidney she ha mild arthritis for the last 10 or 15 year she ha a history of gerd for the last 20 year and she also ha a history of peptic ulcer disease in the duodenum but never had any bleeding she ha a history of diverticulosis a mentioned no history of tia or cva she ha one kidney she wa in a car accident in 1978 and afterwards she had to have left

artery pressure are appropriate for this situation there is a gradient of at most 2 mmhg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary artery to the glenn shunt the left atrial mean pressure is normal right ventricular enddiastolic pressure is at most slightly elevated there is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neoaortic valve stenosis there is a roughly 10mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta on pullback from ascending to descending aorta there is a 6mmhg gradient between the two systemic blood pressure is normal iii oximetry superior vena cava 65 right pulmonary artery 67 left pulmonary artery 65 left atrium 96 right atrium 87 inferior vena cava 69 aorta 86 right ventricle 83 interpretation systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal consistent with a normal cardiac output left atrial saturation is fairly normal consistent with normal oxygenation in the lung the saturation fall passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return a would be expected in this patient iv special procedure s none done v calculation please see the calculation sheet calculation were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption the _____

pulmonary artery is widely patent without stenosis the proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed but doe open up near it branch point the right pulmonary artery measure 65 the left pulmonary artery measure 30 mm the aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection wa 55 mm there is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe flow to both upper lobe is diminished versus lower lung field there is normal return of the pulmonary vein from the right with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium there is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein there is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium the right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function the calculated ejection fraction from the lao projection is only mildly diminished at 59 there is no significant tricuspid regurgitation the neoaortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis the ascending aorta is dilated there is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area on some projection there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch probably secondary to this patient style of norwood reconstruction there is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobe from collateral blood flow with the left being more opacified than the right the inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium the ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency which is probably catheterinduced the coronary artery are poorly seen again a portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated there is faint opacification of the left upper lung

5french jr4 catheter prior to the introduction of the 5french jr4 nitroglycerin wa administered sublingually the 6french jr4 catheter appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50 there wa backwash of dye into the aorta although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn there is a 50 smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divide into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery we then removed the 6french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5french catheter and again finding a stenosis may be le than 50 at the ostium of the right coronary artery calcification again is

were explained to her to include bleeding infection arterial trauma requiring surgery access issue and recurrence she appears to understand and agrees to proceed description of procedure the patient wa taken to the angio suite placed in a supine position after adequate conscious sedation both groin were prepped with chloraseptic prep cloth towel and paper drape were placed local anesthesia wa administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance the common femoral artery wa accessed guidewire wa threaded followed by a 4french sheath through the 4french sheath a 4french omni flush catheter wa placed the glidewire wa removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery using power injector an aortogram proceeded the catheter wa then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation a timed runoff view of both leg wa performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed runoff in the left i opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach the catheter wa pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire i obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery the omni flush catheter wa advanced to the left distal external iliac artery the glidewire rather exchanged for an amplatz stiff wire this wa left in place and the 4french sheath removed and replaced with a 6french destination 45cm sheath this wa advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed i identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining view of the run off made plan for angioplasty the patient wa given 5000 unit of heparin and this wa allowed to circulate a glidewire wa carefully advanced using roadmapping technique through the functionally occluded blood vessel a 4mm x 4cm angioplasty balloon wa used to dilate the area in question final view after dilatation revealed a dissection a search for a 5mm stent wa performed but none of this wa available for this reason i used a 6mm x 80mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery post dilatation wa performed with a 4mm angioplasty balloon further view of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery no significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan for this reason i chose not to treat any further area in the left leg i then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6french angioseal device attention wa turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered access wa obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified guidewire wa threaded followed by a 4french sheath this wa immediately exchanged for the 6french destination sheath after the glidewire wa used to access the distal external iliac artery the glidewire wa exchanged for the amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath the destination wa placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained initial view had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal view of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocity in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery for this reason i performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4mm balloon a minimal dissection plane measuring le than 1 cm wa identified at the proximal area of dilatation no further significant abnormality wa identified to avoid placing a stent in the small vessel i left it alone and approached the popliteal artery a 3mm balloon wa chosen to dilate a 50 to 79 popliteal artery stenosis reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4mm balloon could have been used however due to her propensity for dissection i opted not to i then exchanged the glidewire for an o1 for thruway guidewire using an exchange length this wa placed into the left posterior tibial artery a 2mm balloon wa used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery i then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel final image showed improved runoff to the right calf the

her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time she doe have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and i found an ekg report by dr x which show atrial fibrillation on 08 29 07 per her report one of the question we were asked wa whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin clearly given her history of small ministrokes i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin a the patient herself state that she ha only fallen twice in the past year i would defer that decision to dr z and dr xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate recommendation 1 fall assessment a per dr z and dr xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on coumadin given her history of small stroke a documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she doe have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol 2 the patient ha elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis 3 regarding this minimal troponin elevation i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her smalltomoderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that ha been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08 07 where they felt that there wa some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it wa felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study a well 4 continue norvasc for history of hypertension a well a labetalol 5 the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary cva thromboprophylaxis albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin 6 continue dilantin for history of seizure,Heart

three day ago and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her i advised her to call 911 which she did while waiting for 911 she wa attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain by the time she presented here she is currently painfree and is feeling well past cardiac history the patient ha been having arm pain for several month she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several month with me which wa equivocal but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy so we put her on a betablocker however her arm pain symptom accelerated and she had some jaw pain so she presented to the emergency room on 08 16 08 she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80 mid lad lesion circumflex normal and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collateral from the left to the right a well a right to right to that area the decision wa made to transfer her a she may be having collateral insufficiency

of the right coronary artery in any case given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she wa even pain free i am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy we will continue her betablocker and i can not increase the dose because she is bradycardic already aspirin plavix valsartan lipitor and norvasc i am going to add imdur and watch headache a she apparently had some on nitro paste before and we will rule out mi although there is a little suspicion i suppose it is possible that she ha noncardiac arm pain but that seems le likely a it ha been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker so we can maximize betablocker use for antianginal effect my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention which wa
